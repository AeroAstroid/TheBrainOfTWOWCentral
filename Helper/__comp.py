# This is a components file to contain useful objects to be used by scripts in general

# All commands are divided into different categories
# This categorization is purely cosmetic and makes no difference in functionality

# Categories are organized with a name and a display emoji for the help pages

CATEGORIES = {
	"BRAIN": "<:brainoftwowcentral:981613248384225290>",
	# BRAIN category: commands tied directly to the bot and its own functionality

	"SERVER": "ðŸ“‘",
	# SERVER category: commands that are server-specific, including staff action commands
}

# These are the main Discord-related imports common to scripts
# All command, task and event files import from this file, and thus get these too
