# B*
The B* Bot.

This bot uses a system called tags, which are community made programs that can be run on the bot.

A successor to both oldtag and newtag from TWOW Central.

Why should you use it? If you've ever coded in b++ you should, but that's kind of a dumb thing to say since you most likely never heard of it.

Are there any other reasons? /shrug
